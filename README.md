# Observational-Astro-Task-1-KC

Here are the Python notebooks that I have worked on for the given task. 
I do realise that a few of these processed images have not been processed as well as they could have been. However, due to the time constraint, I am forced to upload them as they are.
I am hoping to learn from your feedback more on how to process these images to make them look stunning and beautiful. It (processing) is not as easy as it seemed to me initially.

The filenames of the notebooks that I have uploaded give an idea of which stellar body I had chosen to observe.
I am not attaching the FITS files themselves, since they are a bit too large. They have been taken from publicly available databases (such as those of NASA and SDSS).
